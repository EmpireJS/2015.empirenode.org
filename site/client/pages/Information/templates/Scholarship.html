                <p >EmpireNode exists to educate and grow the Javascript community in New York City. We are excited to
                    announce that we will be granting scholarships for our upcoming conference. We are constantly
                    seeking
                    new ways to make our community broader and more inclusive. What is building diversity to us?
                    Encouraging
                    community members from any underrepresented group in tech to attend and participate. This
                    scholarship is
                    open to anyone who will be in New York City on October 23rd. This is a community run event; we hope
                    in
                    the future we are able to provide travel and lodging, but cannot do so as part of this
                    initiative.</p >

                <p >We hope this scholarship program can enable you to join us and contribute to our community!</p >
