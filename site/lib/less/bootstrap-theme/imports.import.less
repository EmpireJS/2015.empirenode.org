// What's up with all the imports?
//
// There is a reason for the madness. From the app, just import this file.
// Here's the full process:
//
// custom.bootstrap.import.less is the main import to customize bootstrap.
// in order to customize bootstrap, we need to customize that file. That file is
// generated when you update the package, so we want to keep changes to it at a minimum.
// To solve this, we have a variables.import.less file that we import into
// custom.bootstrap.import.less
//
// We now can import that file that will be used as imports for our theme, and
// for bootstrap, and it contains everything we need from both
//
// So long as we just import this file everywhere, all the files will load in the
// correct order.
//
@import 'lib/less/vendor/bootstrap/custom.bootstrap.import.less';
